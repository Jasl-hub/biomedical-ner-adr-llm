# Biomedical NER and ADR Extraction Using Large Language Models

This project focuses on extracting biomedical named entities such as **Drugs**, **Diseases**, **Symptoms**, and **Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)** from unstructured patient forum text using a transformer-based model. The goal is to enable structured analysis of medical text by mapping extracted ADRs to standard **SNOMED CT** codes.

## üìå Objectives

- Perform **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** on patient-reported medical forum posts.
- Label text using the **BIO (Beginning, Inside, Outside)** tagging format.
- Normalize extracted **ADR** mentions using **SNOMED CT** medical codes.
- Convert model output to `.ann` format for compatibility with existing annotation pipelines.
- Evaluate the pipeline's performance using both string-based and embedding-based matching techniques.

## üß† Dataset

- **Dataset Used:** [CADEC.v2 Dataset (CSIRO)](https://data.csiro.au/collection/csiro:10948?q=CADEC)  
  A curated dataset of patient forum posts mentioning medications and medical conditions.

- **Directory Structure:**
  - `text/` ‚Äì Raw patient forum posts
  - `original/` ‚Äì Ground truth annotations in `.ann` format
  - `meddra/` ‚Äì MedDRA-based ADR labels
  - `sct/` ‚Äì SNOMED CT mappings for standardization
